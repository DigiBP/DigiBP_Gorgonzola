Welcome to our Gorgonzola Wiki-page! We are pleased to present the Digitalization of the Job Reporting Obligation Process inspired by a part of SBB recruitment. In this Wiki-page, firstly you will find the background information in the introduction. Then, the SBB's initial process is translated into an as-is process in order to identify existing pain points. Next, we propose six automated tasks in the to-be process, followed by an explanation of the technical solution approach. Finally, we summarize the whole learning and implementation journey in the conclusion. Below is our table of contents.
